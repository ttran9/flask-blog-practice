- For the initial chapter upload I am having trouble with the export_posts function but I will push changes
and looking for why that is occuring.
    - My issue is that sending the e-mail with all a user's posts is not working the progress is stuck
    at 0%.
        - It should be noted that the password recovery e-mail is still working as expected.

- This repository is so I can practice writing a Python web application using Flask and Python 3.

- This repository will not be using TDD, however after completing this tutorial I will implement the weather forecast prototype using TDD with Python and Flask.
    - Some parts of this tutorial will have tests.

- This repository will have the changes complete up to the chapter the repository is named after.
