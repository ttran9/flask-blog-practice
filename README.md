# Practice Blog #

- This repository is so I can practice writing a Python web application using Flask and Python 3.

- I am just following a series of tutorials from [here](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

- This repository will not be using TDD, however after completing this tutorial I will implement the weather forecast prototype using TDD with Python and Flask.
